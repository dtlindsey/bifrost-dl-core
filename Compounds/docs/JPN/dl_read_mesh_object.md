# `dl_read_bob_mesh`

A basic compound to make reading model data more pipeline friendly.\
Filepaths are generated by inputs, and the mesh is read of disk.  \
This makes it easier to understand what files and versions used in a Bifrost graph.\
Full path will read from:\
`{directory_path}/{asset_name}/{asset_flavor}/{asset_resolution}/{padded_version}/bob/{asset_name}__{asset_flavor}_{resolution}.bob`

# `Inputs`

## `FilepathData`

### `directory_path`
String to model directory.  This will expand variables that are set.\
Default: ${PROJ}/bifrost/models

### `asset_name`

String that represents the asset name as it was written on disk.\
Default: asset

### `asset_flavor`

String that represents the asset _flavor_.  (i.e. clean, dirty, base, thin, muscular, etc.)\
Default: base

### `asset_resolution`

String that represents the resolution of your given model asset.\
Default: lo (common are xlo, lo, hi, xhi, med, full)

## `VersionData`

### `version_number`

What version is the model you're reading.  (1, 2, 10, 500)

### `version_padding`

How many total numbers are used to create a version number?\
Default: 4 (4 becomes 0004, 100 becomes 0100, etc.)

## `Outputs`

### `out_dl_mesh`

New Amino::object read from disk.  As this is expected to be a static model, only the zero frame is read in.

### `file_path`

String of the full filepath that was built and read in

### `success`

Bool represents if the file was read or not.
